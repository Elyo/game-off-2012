<p>Jenkins build status: <a href="http://jenkins.marlinc.nl/job/MS-Game/"><img src="http://jenkins.marlinc.nl/job/MS-Game/badge/icon" alt="Build Status"></a></p>

<p>You can find our Jenkins Build-Bot job over <a href="http://jenkins.marlinc.nl/job/MS-Game/">here</a>.
We don't have a Travis-CI test-set yet but this may come in the future.</p>

<h2>Compiling from the command line</h2>

<p>You can compile MS-Game from the command line using Ant.
At the moment we have one build targets:</p>

<ul>
<li>jar</li>
</ul><p>Building a target is done by simply executing:</p>

<p><code>ant jar</code></p>

<p>This will automatically clean the build, compile the source and create a jar with all the necessary libraries.</p>

</ul><h2>GitHub Game-Off 2012</h2>

<p>Here at GitHub, we're no strangers to hosting or sponsoring hackathons. With the growing number of games and game development resources on GitHub, we thought it was about time to throw our very own game jam!</p>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>

<p>You have the entire month of November to create a <strong>web-based</strong> game <em>loosely</em> built around one or more of the following themes:</p>

<ul>
<li>forking (or forks)</li>
<li>branching (or branches)</li>
<li>cloning (or clones)</li>
<li>pushing</li>
<li>pulling</li>
</ul><p>What do we mean by <strong>loosely</strong> based on these concepts? We literally mean, <em>loosely</em> based. Some examples might be a FPS where you throw forks at water balloons, an educational game about DNA cloning, or perhaps a platformer where you push and pull objects.</p>

<p>Your game. Your rules. You can participate as an individual or as a team. You're encouraged to use open source libraries, frameworks, graphics, and sounds.</p>

<h2>Prizes</h2>

<p>We have 5 shiny new iPads with Retina displays (64GB wifi models) to give to our winners (or Apple Store Credit equivalent). Runners up will receive GitHub swag of their choice ($100 credit for the <a href="http://shop.github.com/">GitHub Shop</a>). If you have a team submission, we'll give you Apple Store credit equal to the value of the iPad. You can split it with your teammates as appropriate.</p>

<p>All of the winners and runners up will be showcased on our blog.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lxZrD.png"></p>

<h3>Everyone's a winner!</h3>

<p>All participants will receive a limited edition <a href="http://www.coderwall.com">Coderwall</a> badge as shown above. Winners and runners up will also get their own special version of it.</p>
