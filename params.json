With the growing number of games and game development resources on GitHub, we thought it was about time to throw our very own game jam!\r\n\r\n## The Challenge\r\n\r\nYou have the entire month of November to create a **web-based** game *loosely* built around one or more of the following themes:\r\n\r\n* forking (or forks)\r\n* branching (or branches)\r\n* cloning (or clones)\r\n* pushing\r\n* pulling\r\n\r\nWhat do we mean by **loosely** based on these concepts? We literally mean, *loosely* based. Some examples might be a FPS where you throw forks at water balloons, an educational game about DNA cloning, or perhaps a platformer where you push and pull objects.\r\n\r\nYour game. Your rules. You can participate as an individual or as a team. You're encouraged to use open source libraries, frameworks, graphics, and sounds.\r\n\r\n## Prizes\r\n\r\nWe have 5 shiny new iPads with Retina displays (64GB wifi models) to give to our winners (or Apple Store Credit equivalent). Runners up will receive GitHub swag of their choice ($100 credit for the [GitHub Shop](http://shop.github.com/)). If you have a team submission, we'll give you Apple Store credit equal to the value of the iPad. You can split it with your teammates as appropriate.\r\n\r\nAll of the winners and runners up will be showcased on our blog.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/lxZrD.png\" style=\"border:0;\">\r\n\r\n### Everyone's a winner!\r\n\r\nAll participants will receive a limited edition [Coderwall](http://www.coderwall.com) badge as shown above.
